👋 Hi, I’m @AfshinAgile  
- 👀 I’m interested in Agile coaching and Scrum Mastery, helping teams and organizations achieve their full potential. As Iran’s first Agile Leader of the Year in 2023, I bring extensive experience in Agile transformation and leadership.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate AI into Agile methodologies to drive innovation in large-scale organizations.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Agile transformation projects, where my experience as an Agile Coach and PMO/ATO Manager in Iran’s largest retail holding with over 20,000 employees can help create value.  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/afshin-samavati or via email at afshinagilecoach@gmail.com.  
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer not to reference gender.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a project management and business analysis instructor, I once used a 1000-piece puzzle to teach Scrum, and I also organized and pioneered the largest OK-Talk event in a 20,000-employee organization to share lessons learned and promote knowledge transfer!
